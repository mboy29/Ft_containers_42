# Ft_containers_42

Within this project, you will implement some C++ containers of the STL (Standard Template Library). Specifically, you will be required to implement Vector, Stack and Map containers while adhering to C++98.
To correctly implement these containers, the following elements should also be implemented: iterators_traits, reverse_iterator, enable_if, is_integral, equal and/or lexicographical_compare, std::pair and std::make_pair.

Tester Containers_test by mlia42: (https://github.com/mli42/containers_test)

Makefile usage:
- Make: creates two executable, one testing the STL containers and the other testing my re-implementation, aka FT ;
- Make test: executes both STL and FT tests and compares both ouputs (stored in in. /Output repository) 
- Make time: executes both STL and FT tests, compares output and performances (time).
